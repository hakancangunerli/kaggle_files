# In this exercise, you will work with data from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).

# 
# Run the next code cell without changes to load the training and validation sets in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.  The test set is loaded in `X_test`.

# In[2]:


import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Read the data
X = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv', index_col='Id') 
X_test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv', index_col='Id')

# Remove rows with missing target, separate target from predictors
X.dropna(axis=0, subset=['SalePrice'], inplace=True)
y = X.SalePrice
X.drop(['SalePrice'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# To keep things simple, we'll drop columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = [col for col in X.columns if X[col].isnull().any()] 
X.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1, inplace=True)
X_test.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1, inplace=True)

# Break off validation set from training data
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y,
                                                      train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2,
                                                      random_state=0)


# Use the next code cell to print the first five rows of the data.

# In[3]:


X_train.head()


# Notice that the dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables.  You'll need to encode the categorical data before training a model.
# 
# To compare different models, you'll use the same `score_dataset()` function from the tutorial.  This function reports the [mean absolute error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) (MAE) from a random forest model.

# In[4]:


from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# function for comparing different approaches
def score_dataset(X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid):
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_valid)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)


# # Step 1: Drop columns with categorical data
# 
# You'll get started with the most straightforward approach.  Use the code cell below to preprocess the data in `X_train` and `X_valid` to remove columns with categorical data.  Set the preprocessed DataFrames to `drop_X_train` and `drop_X_valid`, respectively.  

# In[5]:


# Fill in the lines below: drop columns in training and validation data
drop_X_train = X_train.select_dtypes(exclude= ['object'])
drop_X_valid = X_valid.select_dtypes(exclude= ['object'])

# Check your answers
step_1.check()


# In[6]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_1.hint()
# step_1.solution()


# Run the next code cell to get the MAE for this approach.

# In[7]:


print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop categorical variables):")
print(score_dataset(drop_X_train, drop_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))


# Before jumping into ordinal encoding, we'll investigate the dataset.  Specifically, we'll look at the `'Condition2'` column.  The code cell below prints the unique entries in both the training and validation sets.

# In[8]:


print("Unique values in 'Condition2' column in training data:", X_train['Condition2'].unique())
print("\nUnique values in 'Condition2' column in validation data:", X_valid['Condition2'].unique())


# # Step 2: Ordinal encoding
# 
# ### Part A
# 
# If you now write code to: 
# - fit an ordinal encoder to the training data, and then 
# - use it to transform both the training and validation data, 
# 
# you'll get an error.  Can you see why this is the case?  (_You'll need  to use the above output to answer this question._)

# In[9]:


# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
step_2.a.check()


# In[10]:


#step_2.a.hint()


# This is a common problem that you'll encounter with real-world data, and there are many approaches to fixing this issue.  For instance, you can write a custom ordinal encoder to deal with new categories.  The simplest approach, however, is to drop the problematic categorical columns.  
# 
# Run the code cell below to save the problematic columns to a Python list `bad_label_cols`.  Likewise, columns that can be safely ordinal encoded are stored in `good_label_cols`.

# In[11]:


# Categorical columns in the training data
object_cols = [col for col in X_train.columns if X_train[col].dtype == "object"]

# Columns that can be safely ordinal encoded
good_label_cols = [col for col in object_cols if 
                   set(X_valid[col]).issubset(set(X_train[col]))]
        
# Problematic columns that will be dropped from the dataset
bad_label_cols = list(set(object_cols)-set(good_label_cols))
        
print('Categorical columns that will be ordinal encoded:', good_label_cols)
print('\nCategorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset:', bad_label_cols)


# ### Part B
# 
# Use the next code cell to ordinal encode the data in `X_train` and `X_valid`.  Set the preprocessed DataFrames to `label_X_train` and `label_X_valid`, respectively.  
# - We have provided code below to drop the categorical columns in `bad_label_cols` from the dataset. 
# - You should ordinal encode the categorical columns in `good_label_cols`.  

# In[12]:


from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

# Drop categorical columns that will not be encoded
label_X_train = X_train.drop(bad_label_cols, axis=1)
label_X_valid = X_valid.drop(bad_label_cols, axis=1)

# Apply ordinal encoder 
enc = OrdinalEncoder()
label_X_train[good_label_cols]= enc.fit_transform(X_train[good_label_cols])
label_X_valid[good_label_cols]= enc.transform(X_valid[good_label_cols])
    
# Check your answer
step_2.b.check()


# In[13]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_2.b.hint()
#step_2.b.solution()


# Run the next code cell to get the MAE for this approach.

# In[14]:


print("MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(label_X_train, label_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))


# So far, you've tried two different approaches to dealing with categorical variables.  And, you've seen that encoding categorical data yields better results than removing columns from the dataset.
# 
# Soon, you'll try one-hot encoding.  Before then, there's one additional topic we need to cover.  Begin by running the next code cell without changes.  

# In[15]:


# Get number of unique entries in each column with categorical data
object_nunique = list(map(lambda col: X_train[col].nunique(), object_cols))
d = dict(zip(object_cols, object_nunique))

# Print number of unique entries by column, in ascending order
sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])


# # Step 3: Investigating cardinality
# 
# ### Part A
# 
# The output above shows, for each column with categorical data, the number of unique values in the column.  For instance, the `'Street'` column in the training data has two unique values: `'Grvl'` and `'Pave'`, corresponding to a gravel road and a paved road, respectively.
# 
# We refer to the number of unique entries of a categorical variable as the **cardinality** of that categorical variable.  For instance, the `'Street'` variable has cardinality 2.
# 
# Use the output above to answer the questions below.

# In[16]:


# Fill in the line below: How many categorical variables in the training data
# have cardinality greater than 10?
high_cardinality_numcols = 3

# Fill in the line below: How many columns are needed to one-hot encode the 
# 'Neighborhood' variable in the training data?
num_cols_neighborhood = 25

# Check your answers
step_3.a.check()


# In[17]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_3.a.hint()
#step_3.a.solution()


# ### Part B
# 
# For large datasets with many rows, one-hot encoding can greatly expand the size of the dataset.  For this reason, we typically will only one-hot encode columns with relatively low cardinality.  Then, high cardinality columns can either be dropped from the dataset, or we can use ordinal encoding.
# 
# As an example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, and containing one categorical column with 100 unique entries.  
# - If this column is replaced with the corresponding one-hot encoding, how many entries are added to the dataset?  
# - If we instead replace the column with the ordinal encoding, how many entries are added?  
# 
# Use your answers to fill in the lines below.

# In[18]:


# Fill in the line below: How many entries are added to the dataset by 
# replacing the column with a one-hot encoding?
OH_entries_added = 1e4*100 - 1e4

# Fill in the line below: How many entries are added to the dataset by
# replacing the column with an ordinal encoding?
label_entries_added = 0

# Check your answers
step_3.b.check()


# In[19]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_3.b.hint()
#step_3.b.solution()


# Next, you'll experiment with one-hot encoding.  But, instead of encoding all of the categorical variables in the dataset, you'll only create a one-hot encoding for columns with cardinality less than 10.
# 
# Run the code cell below without changes to set `low_cardinality_cols` to a Python list containing the columns that will be one-hot encoded.  Likewise, `high_cardinality_cols` contains a list of categorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset.

# In[20]:


# Columns that will be one-hot encoded
low_cardinality_cols = [col for col in object_cols if X_train[col].nunique() < 10]

# Columns that will be dropped from the dataset
high_cardinality_cols = list(set(object_cols)-set(low_cardinality_cols))

print('Categorical columns that will be one-hot encoded:', low_cardinality_cols)
print('\nCategorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset:', high_cardinality_cols)


# # Step 4: One-hot encoding
# 
# Use the next code cell to one-hot encode the data in `X_train` and `X_valid`.  Set the preprocessed DataFrames to `OH_X_train` and `OH_X_valid`, respectively.  
# - The full list of categorical columns in the dataset can be found in the Python list `object_cols`.
# - You should only one-hot encode the categorical columns in `low_cardinality_cols`.  All other categorical columns should be dropped from the dataset. 

# In[21]:


from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Use as many lines of code as you need!

OH_encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)
OH_cols_train = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[low_cardinality_cols]))
OH_cols_valid = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.transform(X_valid[low_cardinality_cols]))

# One-hot encoding removed index; put it back
OH_cols_train.index = X_train.index
OH_cols_valid.index = X_valid.index

# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
num_X_train = X_train.drop(object_cols, axis=1)
num_X_valid = X_valid.drop(object_cols, axis=1)

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
OH_X_train = pd.concat([num_X_train, OH_cols_train], axis=1)
OH_X_valid = pd.concat([num_X_valid, OH_cols_valid], axis=1)

# Check your answer
step_4.check()


# In[22]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_4.hint()
#step_4.solution()


# Run the next code cell to get the MAE for this approach.

# In[23]:


print("MAE from Approach 3 (One-Hot Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(OH_X_train, OH_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

# # Keep going
# 
# With missing value handling and categorical encoding, your modeling process is getting complex. This complexity gets worse when you want to save your model to use in the future. The key to managing this complexity is something called **pipelines**. 
# 
# **[Learn to use pipelines](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/pipelines)** to preprocess datasets with categorical variables, missing values and any other messiness your data throws at you.
